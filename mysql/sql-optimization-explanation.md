# SQL Query Performance Optimization Analysis

## Current Query Issues
The original query taking 8 seconds to execute has several performance bottlenecks:

1. **Inefficient Text Search Pattern**
   - Uses `LIKE '%keyword%'` with wildcards at both ends
   - This prevents the use of indexes, forcing full table scans
   - Particularly inefficient for Japanese text (キャビンアテンダント)
   - Applied across 19 different columns from multiple tables

2. **Complex Join Structure**
   - Contains 8 LEFT JOINs and 2 INNER JOINs
   - Each join multiplies the potential rows to be processed
   - Many joins are only needed for the text search
   - Unnecessary joins remain even when their tables don't match the search criteria

3. **Suboptimal WHERE Clause**
   - Multiple OR conditions prevent efficient index usage
   - Each OR condition potentially triggers a full table scan
   - Conditions are not arranged for optimal index utilization

4. **Inefficient Column Selection**
   - Selects all columns from main tables
   - Unnecessary data transfer between database and application
   - Increased memory usage and network bandwidth

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Text Search Optimization
**Implementation:**
- Replace `LIKE '%keyword%'` with Full-Text Search indexes
- Use MATCH AGAINST for text searches
- Create separate full-text indexes for frequently searched columns

**Benefits:**
- Specialized text search algorithms
- Better handling of Japanese text
- Utilizes index structures instead of full table scans
- Typically 100x faster than LIKE with wildcards

### 2. Join Structure Optimization
**Implementation:**
- Move related table searches into a subquery using UNION ALL
- Keep only essential joins in the main query
- Use EXISTS clause for relationship checks where appropriate

**Benefits:**
- Reduces number of rows processed
- Allows for better index utilization
- Minimizes temporary table sizes
- More efficient query execution plan

### 3. Index Strategy
**Implementation:**
- Create composite indexes for frequently used conditions:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_jobs_publish_deleted ON jobs(publish_status, deleted);
  CREATE INDEX idx_jobs_sort_order ON jobs(sort_order, id);
  ```
- Add covering indexes for common queries
- Include ORDER BY columns in indexes

**Benefits:**
- Faster data retrieval
- Reduced disk I/O
- Better query plan optimization
- Improved sort operations

### 4. Query Structure Refinement
**Implementation:**
- Select only necessary columns
- Optimize GROUP BY clause
- Use subqueries for complex conditions
- Properly order JOIN conditions

**Benefits:**
- Reduced data transfer
- Better memory utilization
- More efficient execution plan
- Improved maintainability

### 5. Additional Optimizations

#### A. Data Partitioning
- Consider partitioning large tables by date
- Implement archive strategies for old data
- Use partition pruning for better performance

#### B. Caching Strategy
- Implement result caching for frequent searches
- Use materialized views for common query patterns
- Consider application-level caching

#### C. Database Configuration
- Optimize MySQL settings for large datasets
- Adjust buffer pool size
- Configure query cache appropriately
- Set proper join buffer sizes

## Expected Improvements

1. **Performance Gains:**
   - Query execution time reduction from 8 seconds to sub-second response
   - Significantly reduced CPU usage
   - Lower memory consumption
   - Reduced disk I/O

2. **Scalability Benefits:**
   - Better handling of concurrent queries
   - More efficient resource utilization
   - Improved performance with data growth
   - Reduced server load

3. **Maintenance Advantages:**
   - Clearer query structure
   - Easier debugging
   - Better performance monitoring
   - Simplified optimization process

## Implementation Notes

1. **Migration Steps:**
   - Create new indexes during off-peak hours
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Monitor query performance
   - Keep backup of original query

2. **Monitoring Requirements:**
   - Track query execution time
   - Monitor index usage
   - Check cache hit rates
   - Analyze query plans regularly

3. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Test in staging environment first
   - Have rollback plan ready
   - Monitor system resources
   - Validate result consistency

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Update statistics periodically
   - Review and optimize indexes
   - Clean up unused indexes
   - Monitor data growth patterns

2. **Future Optimizations:**
   - Consider sharding for further scaling
   - Evaluate newer MySQL versions
   - Assess NoSQL solutions for text search
   - Implement data archiving strategy
